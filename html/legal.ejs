                                <p>The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to
                                    or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such
                                    distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us
                                    to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly,
                                    those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their
                                    own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to
                                    the extent local laws are applicable.</p>

                                <p>The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health
                                    Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security

                                    laws, you may not use the Services. You may not use the Services in a way that would
                                    violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).</p>

                                <h3>Restrictions</h3>
                                <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the
                                    Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall
                                    be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any
                                    Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilise class action
                                    procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in
                                    a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other
                                    persons.</p>

                                <p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions
                                    concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to
                                    enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property
                                    rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of
                                    theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorised use; and (c) any claim for
                                    injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then
                                    neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of
                                    this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be
                                    decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
                                    jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of
                                    that court.</p>

                                    you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal
                                    Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal Terms
                                    operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our
                                    rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable

                                        include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal

                                        monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for
                                        recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not

                                        automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
                                        for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform

                                    <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT

                                    <p>If you submit the request through an authorised agent, we may need to collect

                                        regarding your request, you may appeal our decision by emailing us at
                                        <strong>hello@stalw.art</strong>. We will inform you in writing of any action
